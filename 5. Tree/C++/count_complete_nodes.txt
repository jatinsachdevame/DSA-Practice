 Count Complete Tree Nodes
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:

Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6




class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if(!root)
        return 0;
        if(!root->left && root->right)
            return 1;
        if(root->left && !root->right)
            return 2;
        int l=countNodes(root->left);
        int r=countNodes(root->right);
        return l+r+1;
    }
};
